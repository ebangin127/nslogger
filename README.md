Naraeon SSD Lifelogger
========
Naraeon SSD Lifelogger(a.k.a NSLogger) is an open source SSD endurance tester.
NSLogger can read and replay JESD219A Master Trace workload and workloads that have same format with it.
But beware. Just using this program doesn't make your test JESD219A-compatible.
There're a lot of things to consider when you do JESD219A client workload test.
